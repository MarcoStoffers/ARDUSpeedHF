## Programming adapter for the HobbyKing 6A & 10A ESC
![BuildPogoPinAdapter](https://marcostoffers.github.io/pogopinadapt02.jpg)

This is a very tiny ISP adapter to reprogram the HobbyKing 6A & 10A ESC without soldering any wires to it. It uses PogoPins "P75 J1". The PCB is simple but very difficult to solder. You need good soldering experience and a lot of flux.

## Using
Cut off a small part of the Heatshrink at the bottom of the ESC (back side). There you find the 6 programming pads. Connect an AVRISP programmer to the 6pin header, bring the PogoPin adapter on to the PCB and press it down a bit to get better contact. Start Reading/Burning etc.
