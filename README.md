## Arduino based Sketch for some Brushless ESC from China to control a brushed Motor

ARDUSpeedHF is an Arduino Sketch, working on Arduino IDE 1.8.5+ to flash a brushless ESC from China to a brushed ESC. There are more versions available for different kind of ESC Hardware. So please have a look into the folders!

## Warning
All Sketches are tested and working fine in the given ESCs. But if the chinese manufacturer changes something on the PCB (because it's cheaper), I can not guarantee for a normal operation yet. So do it all on your own risk!
